# LOG of process to turn Kanute into an R package.

# TODO:-
# documentation  - roxygen2 format
# structure
# examples
# example data, test data
# vignette
# add function to create a testing folder with primitive examples (ls, cat, print)
# transfer hosting to github to make public.
# Test that can be installed from Github.  install_github(repo="davetgerrard/kanute")

# May attempt to use devtools. https://github.com/hadley/devtools

# How to start?

# Installed Rtools on windows machine
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
# installed Rtools 3.1 as important to match with R version (3.1.1)


# tried out devtools::create()    very similar to package skeleton, but create() does 'create' man/ directory or Rd files from the current environ.
# Additionally, create() adds a package.Rproj file for Rstudio and a git.ignore file (.Rproj, .Rdata, .Rhistory).
# so basic package structure requires named folder 'kanute' with R/ sub-dir.
# at top level NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION files.



# Changed over to GitHub for public hosting.  Used Githubs import tool, supplying URL or Bitbucket repo.

# then in each instance (PC and on compute cluster), changed remote thus
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/davetgerrard/kanute.git

# on Compute cluster I didn't have email or user.name set. I played around with these and managed to break the .git so that I could no longer upload. 
# In the end I removed the repository: rm -rF kanute/
# then clone it anew
git clone https://github.com/davetgerrard/kanute.git
